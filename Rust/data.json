    "Description": "This roadmap provides a comprehensive guide to learning Rust programming language, starting from the basics and building up to advanced concepts. The roadmap is divided into five key divisions, each covering a specific aspect of Rust programming. The first division, \"Fundamentals\", provides an introduction to the basic syntax and concepts of Rust, including variables, data types, control flow, functions, and ownership. The second division, \"Structures\", covers the basic structures in Rust such as structs, enums, traits, modules, and crates. \"Concurrency\" is the third division, where you will learn about concurrent programming in Rust, including threads, channels, async and futures. The fourth division, \"Advanced Features\", delves into more advanced features such as unsafe code, macro programming, generics, and web development. Finally, the fifth division, \"Mastery\", focuses on taking your skills to the next level, including the Rust Standard Library, advanced topics, and the importance of practice and community engagement. By following this roadmap, you will gain a deep understanding of Rust programming language, and be well equipped to develop complex programs with confidence.",

            "Description": "In this division, you will get introduced to the basics of Rust programming language and its syntax. The topics covered in this division include Variables and Data Types, which will help you understand how to store and manipulate data. Control Flow topics such as if/else and loops will give you a deeper understanding of how to control the flow of your programs. Functions are an integral part of any programming language, and you will learn how to define and call functions in Rust. Lastly, Ownership is a unique feature of Rust, and in this division, you will learn how to manage resources in a safe and efficient manner.",
